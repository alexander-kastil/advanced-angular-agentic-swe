# Angular Table Column Layout

Stable column geometry for a data table whose rows are loaded a page at a time
(server-side sort plus infinite scroll). Covers the two failure modes that look
opposite but share one cause: **columns that jump**, and **columns that overflow**.

Use this before adding sorting, filtering, resizing, or column visibility to any
list view. Get the geometry right first; every later feature builds on it.

The invariant every leaf here serves:

> In the default, never-resized state the table has **zero horizontal overflow**
> and the last column is **fully visible**.
