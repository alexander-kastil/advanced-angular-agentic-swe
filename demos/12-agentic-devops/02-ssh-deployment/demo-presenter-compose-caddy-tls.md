# Present: Ship the App with Compose, Caddy and TLS

An application goes behind one public edge, and the certificate request is a gate you check rather than a command you retry. Six beats: the security boundary, the named volume, the preconditions, the one directive, the chain proof, the redeploy.

------

**Shell:** beats quote Bash; in PowerShell `DEPLOY` and `SCP` are functions called as `DEPLOY ...` and `SCP ...`, because a command held in a string will not invoke, and `UserKnownHostsFile` reads `NUL`, because `/dev/null` creates a literal `dev\null` file.

## Beats

### Beat 1: `expose` and `ports` are the security boundary (1 min)

**Open:** [`box-stack/docker-compose.yml`](box-stack/docker-compose.yml) · [Step 2: Finish the Compose file with a single public edge](demo-compose-caddy-tls.md#step-2-finish-the-compose-file-with-a-single-public-edge)
**Say:** On your own box, what the internet can reach is decided entirely by fields you write. Exactly one container faces the public and every other one is reachable only through it.

```text
  caddy: caddy:2-alpine, restart unless-stopped, publishes 80 and 443,
         mounts ./Caddyfile read-only at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile,
         named volumes caddy_data at /data and caddy_config at /config
  app:   internal port 8080 only
```

**Result:** [`box-stack-solution/docker-compose.yml`](box-stack-solution/docker-compose.yml), where the edge holds the only published ports and `app` gains `expose: 8080` with no host mapping

```diff
 services:
+  caddy:
+    image: caddy:2-alpine
+    restart: unless-stopped
+    ports:
+      - "80:80"
+      - "443:443"
```

**Gotcha:** `expose` opens a port on the internal network and `ports` opens it on the host, so confusing them puts the app on the public internet at 8080.

### Beat 2: the certificate lives in a named volume, deliberately (0.5 min)

**Open:** [`box-stack/docker-compose.yml`](box-stack/docker-compose.yml) · [`box-stack/Caddyfile`](box-stack/Caddyfile)
**Say:** Almost everything in a container stack is disposable, and certificates are the exception. Issuance is metered by an outside party, so it is state you cannot regenerate on demand.

```text
- Both services get a healthcheck that probes 127.0.0.1, not localhost.
- Do not add depends_on to the caddy service.
- caddy_data must be a named volume, not a bind mount.
- Put both services on one bridge network named box-net.
```

**Result:** both named volumes arrive with the edge in [`box-stack-solution/docker-compose.yml`](box-stack-solution/docker-compose.yml); the starter declares no top-level `volumes:` key at all

```yaml
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile:ro
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
...
volumes:
  caddy_data: {}
  caddy_config: {}
```

**Gotcha:** `caddy_data` holds the account key and every issued certificate, so a bind mount that a cleanup script deletes costs a fresh round of issuance against a rate limit nobody budgeted.

### Beat 3: the gate the whole module is built around (1.5 min)

**Open:** [readme.md](readme.md#phase-5-let-dns-land-before-acme-runs) · [Step 4: Check the preconditions before the first certificate request](demo-compose-caddy-tls.md#step-4-check-the-preconditions-before-the-first-certificate-request)
**Say:** Most steps in a deployment can be retried until they work, and this is the one that cannot. An attempt made too early makes the next one slower.

```bash
$DEPLOY 'getent hosts box.example.at || echo "NO RECORD: box.example.at does not resolve"'
$DEPLOY 'ss -lntp | grep -E ":(80|443) " || echo "nothing is listening on 80 or 443 yet"'
```

**Result:** both preconditions unmet, so no site block is written and no validation is spent; this beat deliberately produces no file

```text
NO RECORD: box.example.at does not resolve
nothing is listening on 80 or 443 yet
```

**Gotcha:** Caddy asks a public authority the moment a site block loads, and Let's Encrypt caps failed validations at five per hostname per hour, so one premature `compose up` burns the budget for the whole box.

### Beat 4: one directive is the entire difference from production (1 min)

**Open:** [`box-stack/Caddyfile`](box-stack/Caddyfile) · [Step 5: Write the Caddyfile and prove the certificate](demo-compose-caddy-tls.md#step-5-write-the-caddyfile-and-prove-the-certificate)
**Say:** Routing, health probe, automatic redirect and certificate lifecycle all run identically on a laptop. That leaves exactly one open question, which is who signs.

```text
Finish Caddyfile. Keep the existing :8090 block exactly as it is, and add one
site block:

- Site box.example.at, served with Caddy's internal CA (tls internal)
- /healthz inside that site responds "ok" with 200, ordered before the proxy
- everything else reverse proxies to app:8080
```

**Result:** one site block is the whole addition to [`box-stack-solution/Caddyfile`](box-stack-solution/Caddyfile), with `tls internal` as its first line

```diff
+box.example.at {
+	tls internal
...
+	handle {
+		reverse_proxy app:8080
+	}
+}
```

**Gotcha:** a bare `:80` block here would take port 80 from every hostname and kill every HTTP-01 challenge, which is why the box-level probe sits on `:8090`.

### Beat 5: prove the chain, do not wave it through (1 min)

**Open:** [`box-stack-solution/Caddyfile`](box-stack-solution/Caddyfile) · [Step 5: Write the Caddyfile and prove the certificate](demo-compose-caddy-tls.md#step-5-write-the-caddyfile-and-prove-the-certificate)
**Say:** A check that only passes with verification switched off has not passed. Supply the trust anchor explicitly and read back whether validation succeeded.

```bash
$DEPLOY 'curl -sS --cacert /tmp/box-root.crt --resolve box.example.at:443:127.0.0.1 -o /dev/null -w "http=%{http_code} verify=%{ssl_verify_result}\n" https://box.example.at/'
$DEPLOY 'echo | openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443 -servername box.example.at 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -noout -issuer -dates'
```

**Result:** the chain validated against the root Caddy generated into the `caddy_data` volume on the box, never a file in the repository

```text
http=200 verify=0
issuer=CN = Caddy Local Authority - ECC Intermediate
notBefore=Jul 29 20:56:13 2026 GMT
notAfter=Jul 30 08:56:13 2026 GMT
```

**Gotcha:** `verify=0` means the chain validated against a root you supplied, the exact check `curl -k` skips, and `--resolve` proved the hostname live with no DNS record anywhere.

### Beat 6: `restart` never picks up a new image (1 min)

**Open:** [`box-stack/app/src/app/app.html`](box-stack/app/src/app/app.html) · [Step 6: Redeploy and prove the new version is live](demo-compose-caddy-tls.md#step-6-redeploy-and-prove-the-new-version-is-live)
**Say:** Compose verbs read like synonyms and act on different objects. Choosing the wrong one produces no error, no warning and no change.

```bash
$DEPLOY 'cd /opt/box-stack && sed -i "s/Build 2/Build 3/" app/src/app/app.html && docker compose build -q app && docker compose restart app && sleep 2'
$DEPLOY 'curl -sS --cacert /tmp/box-root.crt --resolve box.example.at:443:127.0.0.1 https://box.example.at/ | grep -o "Build ."'
$DEPLOY 'cd /opt/box-stack && docker compose up -d app && sleep 2'
$DEPLOY 'curl -sS --cacert /tmp/box-root.crt --resolve box.example.at:443:127.0.0.1 https://box.example.at/ | grep -o "Build ."'
```

**Result:** after `restart` the page still reads `Build 2` and after `up -d` it reads `Build 3`, while `image: box-app:latest` in [`box-stack-solution/docker-compose.yml`](box-stack-solution/docker-compose.yml) never changes across either verb.

**Gotcha:** the image reference binds at container create time, so `restart` reuses the existing container and its existing image indefinitely; `env_file` behaves identically.

## If the room asks

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| `docker compose ps` says `health: starting`. What is wrong? | Nothing. The healthcheck has a 30 second interval and no `start_period`, so the first probe fires about thirty seconds in. |
| Why does `80/tcp` appear next to `8080/tcp` on the app container? | The final stage of `app/Dockerfile` builds on `nginx:1.27-alpine`, which declares `EXPOSE 80`, and an inherited `EXPOSE` cannot be withdrawn. Neither number has a host mapping. |
| Why does the first `docker compose build app` take minutes? | The first stage pulls `node:22-alpine` and runs `npm ci` and `ng build`; nginx only receives `dist/box-app/browser`, and later builds reuse the cached layers. |
| What exactly changes for a real domain on a real VM? | Two edits to one site block: the real hostname in the site address, and the `tls internal` line deleted. |
| Why do both healthchecks probe `127.0.0.1` rather than `localhost`? | busybox `wget` resolves `localhost` to `::1` first, while `app/nginx.conf` says `listen 8080` and binds IPv4 only. |
